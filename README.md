This is a locally run site I have built to manage and track bulk sneaker orders.

Some of the capabilities includes
- scraping all orders placed on my account from the ugg.ca website and storing them in a local database
- scraping all orders placed on my account from the adidas.ca website and storing them in a local database
- Using many couriers APIs such as UPS, Tforce and Purolator to get up to date tracking updates on orders scraped
- Allowing any tracking numbers to be inputted for tracking as well
- Displaying all orders places and tracking numbers currently being monitored
